# Word2vec_numpy
## Word2Vec implementation from scratch using NumPy and Jupyter Notebook.
This project implements the Word2Vec Skip‑Gram model with Negative Sampling using only NumPy inside a single Jupyter Notebook. It walks through the full process of building word embeddings from raw text, focusing on clarity and understanding rather than external libraries.


## Contents
- word2vec_numpy.ipynb — complete implementation with:
- text preprocessing
- vocabulary creation
- skip‑gram pair generation
- negative sampling
- forward and backward passes
- training loop
- similarity queries
- Text.txt — the dataset used for training

## How to Run
- Open word2vec_numpy.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
- Run all cells in order.
- The notebook will train a Word2Vec model and allow similarity lookups.
