Word2vec is a shallow, two-layer neural network technique developed by Google that converts text into numerical vectors (word embeddings) to capture semantic relationships and meanings. It analyzes large text corpora to represent words in a continuous vector space where similar words are closer together. It is primarily used for NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, machine translation, and search relevance. 

Key Aspects of Word2Vec:

Purpose: Converts unstructured text into high-dimensional vectors, enabling mathematical operations on words (e.g., king - man + woman = queen).

Core Principle: Words that appear in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings.

Architectures:

Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW): Predicts a target word based on surrounding context words.

Skip-gram: Predicts surrounding context words based on a single target word.
Applications: Used in search relevance, sentiment analysis, content recommendation, and word similarity detection. 

Word2vec is crucial because it allows computer models to understand the semantic, rather than just syntactic, relationships between words.
